This is just simpe nero-net generator.

For example I can offer you simple example:

Input parametrs of neural network:

1. big motor
2. small motor
3. hasn't motor
4. it has doors
5. 2 wheels
6. 4 wheels
7. perol-powered
8. diesel-powered

Example of use in command line:

./nero_net_v2_learning.py

./nero_net_v2_using.py 1.txt 01001000

In this case:

1. txt - output file of nero_net_v2_learning.py (if it finished successfully)
2. 0100100 - input parametrs for our net (it is electric motorcycle)
